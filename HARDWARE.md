### U8 TMC2209 — Motor 2 (Y)

Same topology as U7. Net names are Y-* instead of X-*.

| Signal       | GPIO  |
|--------------|-------|
| Y-EN         | 14    |
| Y-DIR        | 15    |
| Y-STEP       | 16    |
| Y-UART (PDN) | 17    |
| Y-DIAG       | 19    |

Sense resistors: R48, R49 (0.11 Ω each).
Optional 0 Ω jumpers R38, R39 near DIR/STEP (unpopulated = NC).

### TMC2209 UART Address

Address is set by MS1/MS2 pin state at reset. Default (both LOW) = address 0.
Firmware uses addr=0 for both motors. MS1/MS2 are not driven by RP2040 GPIOs
in the current schematic — they float or are hardwired; behavior is addr=0.

---

## UART Topology — Critical Hardware Notes

**Single-wire, direct connection. No isolation resistors, no level shifters,
no buffers, no external pull-ups between RP2040 GPIO and TMC PDN_UART.**

```
RP2040 GPIO11 ──────────────── TMC U7 PDN_UART (pin 14)
RP2040 GPIO17 ──────────────── TMC U8 PDN_UART (pin 14)
```

**GPIO13 (X-DIAG) and GPIO11 (X-UART) are SEPARATE PINS on both the RP2040
and the TMC.** The ERB V2.0 pinout diagram labels gpio13 as "UART" which is
misleading — it is wired to TMC DIAG only, not to PDN_UART.

**Consequence:** There is no loopback path for two-wire UART (TX→RX via separate
GPIO). Only single-wire bit-bang (switch GPIO11 between OUTPUT and INPUT) can
work for reads.

### PDN_UART electrical behaviour

| pdn_disable bit | GPIO idle state    | Cause                              |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| 0 (TMC default) | LOW                | TMC internal PDN pull-down (~few kΩ) overcomes RP2040 50 kΩ pull-up |
| 1 (UART mode)   | HIGH               | PDN pull-down deactivated; TMC UART pull-up (~22 kΩ) + RP2040 pull-up hold HIGH |
| Standby mode    | HIGH               | PDN pull-down also deactivated in standby — **indistinguishable from pdn_disable=1 by voltage alone** |

**TMC standby is triggered by holding PDN_UART HIGH for ≥ tST ≈ 1 ms**
(when pdn_disable=0). Previously tmc_init() drove tx_pin HIGH for 10 ms,
reliably triggering standby. In standby the line reads HIGH (like UART mode)
but UART reads return no response. Fixed: preconditioning reduced to 100 µs.

**TX writes work despite PDN pull-down** because line_drive_high() (OUTPUT HIGH)
overcomes the TMC pull-down for '1' bits and stop bits. Before this fix, using
line_idle() (INPUT/PULL_UP) for '1' bits caused the TMC pull-down to corrupt
every '1' bit — all writes were silently corrupted.

### DIAG pin behaviour

| State           | GPIO13 / GPIO19 level |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Normal (no stall)| LOW (push-pull output) |
| Stall detected  | HIGH (push-pull output) |
| Motor disabled  | LOW                    |

DIAG is a push-pull output. In normal operation it permanently holds the GPIO
LOW. This is why earlier attempts to receive UART on GPIO13 always returned
all-zero bytes — DIAG was holding the line LOW throughout, not PDN_UART.

## Power Architecture

| Rail | Source chip     | Input  | Output |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| 5 V  | RY9330BP8 (buck)| 24 V   | 5 V / 3 A max |
| 3.3 V| ME6217C33M5G (LDO)| 5 V | 3.3 V |
| 24 V | External supply | —      | Stepper motor power |

- JP2 (solder jumper): bridges USB 5 V to board 5 V rail for firmware upload
  without 24 V. **Do not close JP2 while 24 V is connected.**
- Stepper VCC_IO (3.3 V) decoupled with C43 (4.7 µF/6.3 V) + C44 (100 nF).
- Motor power decoupled with C29 (100 µF/35 V), C38/C39 (100 nF), C36 (100 nF).

## Firmware Pin Assignments (as used in main.c)

```c
// Lane sensors
PIN_L1_IN   = 2    PIN_L1_OUT  = 3
PIN_L2_IN   = 4    PIN_L2_OUT  = 5
PIN_Y_SPLIT = 6

// Buffer (adjacent pins on header)
PIN_BUF_ADVANCE  = 18   // GPIO18: no named ERB net, accessible on header (row above GPIO12)
PIN_BUF_TRAILING = 12   // GPIO12: PRE_GATE_0 connector

// Motor 1
PIN_M1_EN   = 8    PIN_M1_DIR  = 9    PIN_M1_STEP = 10
PIN_M1_UART_TX = 11
PIN_M1_DIAG    = 13   // same GPIO as PIN_M1_UART_RX (DIAG only, not UART RX)

// Motor 2
PIN_M2_EN   = 14   PIN_M2_DIR  = 15   PIN_M2_STEP = 16
PIN_M2_UART_TX = 17
PIN_M2_DIAG    = 19   // same GPIO as PIN_M2_UART_RX (DIAG only, not UART RX)

// Peripherals
PIN_SERVO    = 23
PIN_NEOPIXEL = 21
```

Note: GPIO12 is confirmed connected (PRE_GATE_0 in the Klipper MMU config, filament
pre-gate sensor). The schematic page for GPIO12 may not show the net label clearly but
the Klipper mmu.cfg and board layout confirm it is routed to a sensor header.
